As a consequence, the informal sector is assessed through correlated indicators in each of the broad components â€” agriculture, trade, construction and manufacturing. Agriculture, one of the largest components, is pretty much entirely informal, Anant said. In agriculture, the statistics office assesses GVA (gross value added) by a combination of data on output, which is generated from data on acreage and yield, for which there are well established regular survey procedures and those are then conflated with value-added data that comes from the cost of cultivation survey, which gives an idea of the value added in the agri sector.
